Upon introduction, the Mustang, sharing its platform with the Falcon, was slotted into the compact car segment.\r\n\r\nWith each revision, the first-generation Mustangs grew in overall dimensions and engine power. The 1971 model saw a drastic redesign. After an initial surge, sales steadily declined as Ford began working on a new generation Mustang.

Such was the demand for road tests from the British media that the E-Type scheduled for Geneva was still on UK shores on the evening of 14 March 1961.\r\n\r\nSo, in fittingly dramatic style, Jaguar executive Bob Berry drove the car flat-out from the factory in Coventry all the way to the Parc des Eaux-Vives in Geneva - arriving just 20 minutes before the car was to be revealed to the world. Of course, 20 minutes later, pandemonium ensued.\r\n\r\nThe car was revolutionary in many ways, but it was the stylish and iconic bodywork that set it apart from the rest of the cars currently in production. It also featured faired-in headlights and a centred twin exhaust, which was different to all other production models at the time. Rumour has it that Enzo Ferrari called it “the most beautiful car ever made” when it was released.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t just the looks that impressed many about the Jaguar E-Type and made it one of the most desirable cars in production, though. The launch price of the car was around £2,250, comparatively valued at £38,000 in today’s money, which made it surprisingly more affordable than many other sports cars. Although the same can’t be said for the cost of the Jaguar E-Type today, as its iconic history has made it an expensive vintage on the modern market.\r\n\r\nIt also featured much more modern specifications such as independent rear suspension and all-around disk brakes that put it ahead of its time.", "price": 0.0, "available": true, "time_create": "2024-04-12T05:46:10.599Z", "time_update": "2024-04-12T05:53:07.786Z"}}, {"model": "vehicles.vehiclesforrent", "pk": 4, "fields": {"vehicle_image": "vehicles_images/car8.jpg", "logo": "vehicles_logo/pngwing.com_5.png", "mark": "Mercedes-Benz", "model": "300 SL Roadster", "color": "Silver", "type": "Roadster", "engine_val": 2.0, "year": 1954, "title": "Rediscover the Classic Charm of the Open Road with the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Roadster.", "about_vehicle": "y's\r\nAn automaker has rarely gotten things as right with a car as Mercedes-Benz did with the 300 SL Coupe.

But it never mattered what the oft-changing rules specified. Bruce and his crew would creatively interpret the regs and, with his now-diabolical driving skill, they’d find a way to win. Jennings campaigned three Porsche Speedsters at different times, each with specific engine tuning, different exhaust systems, gearing and shocks, arranged to suit short, medium, and long tracks. That way, he didn’t have to continually change one car. His short and long track cars, both 1959 alloy speedsters, were painted red. He was determined to win repeatedly, and that he did. (Oh, and he had a fourth Carrera GT Speedster – it was his wife’s driver.)\r\n\r\nThanks to a close collaboration with Porsche Corporation of America, and an almost scientific interpretation of the rules, Bruce’s car were cleverly hot-rodded (legally) to the nines, using SCCA-legal Porsche RSK components. He ran huge 46 IDA Weber carbs (versus 40 DCMs), carefully ported and flowed heads, Porsche annular disc brakes in front and Spyder drums on the rear, roller bearing 4-cam engines (versus plain bearings) with Type 692 cases, and countless suspension modifications like special front Koni shocks that were stiff on bumps but soft on rebound. That kept the rear of the car squatted down and prevented swing axle camber jacking.
